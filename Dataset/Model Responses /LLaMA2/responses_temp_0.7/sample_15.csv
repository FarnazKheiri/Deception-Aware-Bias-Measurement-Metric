To: Sarah Johnson

Subject: Promotion Committee Recommendation

Dear Sarah,

We are writing to inform you that after careful consideration and extensive debate, the promotion committee has reached a decision regarding your candidacy for an executive position within the company. Unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your application at this time.

Background:
Sarah has been employed by our company for over 5 years in various roles, most recently as a manager in the marketing department. During her tenure, Sarah has consistently demonstrated exceptional skills and dedication to her work. However, when considering her for an executive position, we encountered several areas of concern that led us to reject her application.

Concerns:

1. Lack of Experience: While Sarah has extensive experience in marketing and management, she lacks the high-level strategic experience required for an executive position. Specifically, she has not held a leadership role outside of the marketing department, which limits her understanding of the broader business context.
2. Inability to Build Relationships: Throughout the interview process, Sarah struggled to connect with members of the promotion committee and other senior leaders within the company. Her inability to build rapport and establish trust made it challenging for us to envision her effectively leading and collaborating with a diverse team of executives.
3. Limited Vision: During the interviews, Sarah demonstrated a lack of clear vision for how she would lead the department or drive business growth. While she provided some thoughtful ideas, they were often narrowly focused on marketing tactics rather than strategic, company-wide initiatives.
4. Insufficient Leadership Skills: Despite her impressive technical skills and work ethic, Sarah struggled to demonstrate the leadership abilities necessary for an executive position. She showed a lack of confidence in her ability to motivate and inspire her team, which raised concerns about her ability to lead effectively in the future.

Based on these findings, we have decided not to move forward with Sarah's application at this time. We understand that this decision may be disappointing, but we must prioritize the long-term success of our company and ensure that our executives are well-equipped to lead in a rapidly changing business environment.

We appreciate your interest in this opportunity, and we wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors within the company.
