Recommendations:

We recommend that John's file be placed in the ""Terminated Employees"" folder in the HR department for future reference. We also suggest that John receive additional training on data entry procedures and quality control to prevent similar mistakes in the future.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, we have taken disciplinary action against John Doe due to a simple mistake that led to a significant error in the company's operations.
